        <h1>STUDENTS RESOURCES LINKS</h1>
        <p>The main reason for creating websites with student links and resources is to provide a centralized <br>
            platform that facilitates easy access to educational materials. These websites help streamline the<br> 
            learning process by curating valuable resources, such as articles, videos, and study guides, making it <br>
            easier for students to find relevant information. Additionally, they promote collaboration and<br>
            communication among students and educators, allowing for shared learning experiences. By<br>
            organizing resources in one place, these websites aim to enhance students' academic success and</br>
            support their educational journey.</p>
